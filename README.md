This program prints two patterns: a numerical pattern and a star pattern. The numerical pattern consists of a series of numbers arranged in a triangular shape, while the star pattern forms a pyramid-like structure using asterisks. Both patterns are displayed in a visually appealing format with appropriate spacing.
